      "LONDON (AP) — The British government on Saturday ordered an investigation into the country’s “energy resilience” after an electrical substation fire shut Heathrow Airport for almost a day and raised concerns about the U.K.'s ability to withstand disasters or attacks on critical infrastructure. \n",
      "While Heathrow Airport said it was now “fully operational,” thousands of passengers remained stuck, and airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travelers to their destinations. \n",
      "Inconvenienced passengers, angry airlines and concerned politicians all want answers about how one seemingly accidental fire could shut down Europe’s busiest air hub.\n",
      "“This is a huge embarrassment for Heathrow airport. It’s a huge embarrassment for the country that a fire in one electricity substation can have such a devastating effect,” said Toby Harris, a Labour Party politician who heads the National Preparedness Commission, a group that campaigns to improve resilience.\n",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he’d asked the National Energy System Operator, which oversees U.K. gas and electricity networks, to “urgently investigate” the fire, “to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.” \n",
      "It is expected to report initial findings within six weeks.\n",
      "“The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow,” Miliband said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathrow announced its own review, to be led by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, a member of the airport’s board.\n",
      "Heathrow Chairman Paul Deighton said Kelly will look at “the robustness and execution of Heathrow’s crisis management plans, the airport’s response during the incident and how the airport recovered.”\n",
      "More than 1,300 flights were canceled and some 200,000 people stranded Friday after an overnight fire at a substation 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away cut power to Heathrow, and to more than 60,000 properties.\n",
      "Heathrow said Saturday it had “added flights to today’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers.” British Airways, Heathrow’s biggest airline, said it expected to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport Saturday. \n",
      "While many passengers managed to resume stalled journeys, others remained in limbo.\n",
      "Laura Fritschie from Kansas City was on vacation with her family in Ireland when she learned that her father had died. On Saturday she was stranded at Heathrow after her BA flight to Chicago was canceled at the last minute.\n",
      "“I’m very frustrated,” she said. “This was my first big vacation with my kids since my husband died, and ... now this. So I just want to go home.”\n",
      "Residents in west London described hearing a large explosion and then seeing a fireball and clouds of smoke when the blaze ripped through the substation. The fire was brought under control after seven hours, but the airport was shut for almost 18 hours. A handful of flights took off and landed late Friday.\n",
      "Police said they do not consider the fire suspicious, and the London Fire Brigade said its investigation would focus on the substation’s electrical distribution equipment.\n",
      "Still, the huge impact of the fire left authorities facing questions about Britain’s creaking infrastructure, much of which has been privatized since the 1980s. The center-left Labour government has vowed to improve the U.K.'s delay-plagued railways, its aged water system and its energy network, promising to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy independence through investment in wind and other renewable power sources.\n",
      "“The last 40, 50 years we’ve tried to make services more efficient,” said Harris. “We’ve stripped out redundancy, we’ve simplified processes. We’ve moved towards a sort of ‘just in time’ economy. There is an element where you have to make sure you’re available for ‘just in case.’ You have to plan for things going wrong.”\n",
      "Heathrow is one of the world’s busiest airports for international travel, and saw 83.9 million passengers last year. \n",
      "Chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he was “proud” of the way airport and airline staff had responded.\n",
      "“The airport didn’t shut for days. We shut for hours,” he told the BBC.\n",
      "Woldbye said Heathrow’s backup power supply, designed for emergencies, worked as expected, but it wasn’t enough to run the whole airport, which uses as much energy as a small city.\n",
      "“That’s how most airports operate,” said Woldbye, who insisted “the same would happen in other airports” faced with a similar blaze.\n",
      "But Willie Walsh, who heads aviation trade organization IATA, said the episode “begs some serious questions.”\n",
      "“How is it that critical infrastructure – of national and global importance – is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport,” he said.\n",
      "Walsh said “Heathrow has very little incentive to improve” because airlines, not the airport, have to pay the cost of looking after disrupted passengers.\n",
      "Friday’s disruption was one of the most serious since the 2010 eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which shut Europe’s airspace for days.\n",
      "Passengers on about 120 flights were in the air when Friday’s closure was announced and found themselves landing in different cities, and even different countries.\n",
      "Mark Doherty and his wife were halfway across the Atlantic when the inflight map showed their flight from New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport to Heathrow was returning to New York.\n",
      "“I was like, you’re joking,” Doherty said.\n",
      "He called the situation “typical England — got no back-up plan for something happens like this. There’s no contingency plan.”\n",

      "But the transportation grant money is already not enough to meet the need. Last year, Reed ran out of money during the last three months of the fiscal year and had to dip into the Commission’s savings. This year, he said he won’t be able to do so.\n",
      "Then, last Friday, he found out the Commission had lost an almost $1 million grant he expected, again because of the federal government’s cost cutting.\n",

      "“I don’t understand a lot of the stuff that’s going on right now, and I just can’t pinpoint things together, you know,” said Brenda Hughes, 72, who said she usually goes to the Social Security office in person anyway because she said she’s found it difficult to get a hold of the call center. “But maybe it’s meant to be like that.”\n",
      "Mary Weaver, 72, said she doesn’t approve of Trump giving Elon Musk so much leeway to cut and change services, and she doesn’t see those measures helping McDowell County.\n",
      "“He gone run for president, and he’s going to get the presidency, but he’s going to let someone else tell him how to run the country?” she asked, criticizing Trump’s relationship with Musk.\n",

      "CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A voter in Milford, New Hampshire, missed out on approving the town’s $19 million operating budget, electing a cemetery trustee and buying a new dump truck. In Durham, an 18-year-old high school student did not get a say in who should serve on the school board or whether $125,000 should go toward replacing artificial turf on athletic fields.\n",
      "Neither was able to participate in recent town elections in New Hampshire thanks to a new state law requiring proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote. Their experiences, recounted by town clerks, could prove instructive for the rest of the country as the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act advances in Congress and more than a dozen states consider similar legislation.\n",
      "“Everything that conservatives tried to downplay, New Hampshire told us exactly what would happen on a national scale under the SAVE Act,” said Greta Bedekovics, a former policy adviser for Senate Democrats who is now with the Center for American Progress.\n",

      "Voting rights groups are particularly concerned that married women who have changed their names will encounter trouble when trying to register because their birth certificates list their maiden names.\n",
      "That is exactly what happened to Brooke Yonge, a 45-year-old hairstylist who showed up at her polling place in Derry last week determined to show her support for public education.\n",
      "She was turned away initially because she did not have proof of citizenship. When she returned with her birth certificate, that still was not enough because the name on the document did not match the one on her driver’s license. Back home she went to fetch her marriage license to prove she had changed her name.\n",
      "“Third trip around the sun and here we are,” said Yonge, who called the registration requirements reasonable despite the hassle. “If I did a little research, I probably would have known that is what I needed.”\n",
      "New Hampshire is among the 20 states that allow voters to register on the day of an election. According to the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights, at least 56 people who tried to register statewide the day of the March 11 town elections were turned away, though it is unknown how many of them later completed the process.\n",
      "Derry’s town clerk, Tina Guilford, wonders how it will go during a November general election, when turnout is much higher.\n",
      "“It’s just heartbreaking to me to see people turn around and think, ‘I hope they come back,’” she said.\n",
      "At least one person who tried to register in Milford on Tuesday did not return, said Joan Dargie, the town clerk. Neither did an older woman who tried to register at Town Hall before the election. The first of the woman’s three marriages was in Florida in the 1970s and that license was long gone, Dargie said.\n",
      "“Sometimes people are like, ‘I didn’t save any paperwork for that. I wanted to forget all that,’” Dargie said. “It’s disenfranchising women.”\n",
      "The U.S. House passed legislation last year to require proof of citizenship for voter registration, but it stalled in the Senate amid Democratic opposition. With Republicans now in full control of Congress, the House is expected to take up the issue again soon.\n",
      "Before the 2024 election, Donald Trump falsely claimed that noncitizens might vote  in large enough numbers to sway the outcome. In fact, research and reviews of state cases have shown voting by noncitizens to be rare and typically a mistake rather than an intentional effort to subvert an election.\n",
      "Republicans argue that even small numbers of noncitizens voting undermines public confidence.\n",
      "New Hampshire’s new law also has had broad support. About 8 in 10 New Hampshire voters in the 2024 election favored requiring people in their state to show a passport, birth certificate or other evidence of U.S. citizenship when they register to vote, according to AP VoteCast, including about 6 in 10 who were strongly in favor. The vast majority of Trump voters were in support of the requirement, but so were more than half of voters for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the race against Republican Trump.\n",
      "During the recent town hall elections, Michael Appleton had to return home to get his birth certificate and provide proof of a name change before he could register and vote. Even so, he wasn’t critical of the new law.\n",
      "“It’s inconvenient for me personally in this moment, but I don’t think it’s an unreasonable thing to ask,” he said.\n",
      "Republican state Rep. Bob Lynn, who sponsored New Hampshire’s law, does not believe there is rampant voter fraud in the state. He also does not believe the new citizenship requirements are unduly burdensome.\n",
      "“It seems to me that voting is pretty important, and it’s not unreasonable to say to people, look, you’re going to have to give a little bit of forethought to what you need in order to vote,” said Lynn, a former chief justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\n",
      "New Hampshire is one of eight states with laws that require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote, and similar legislation is pending in 17 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n",
      "The experience has at times been fraught in some states that have enacted a proof-of-citizenship requirement.\n",
      "In Arizona, a recent state audit found that problems with the way data was handled had affected the tracking and verification of citizenship. It came after officials had identified some 200,000 voters who were thought to have provided citizenship, but had not. \n",
      "A proof of citizenship requirement was in effect for three years in Kansas before it was overturned through legal challenges. The state’s own expert estimated that almost all the roughly 30,000 people who were prevented from registering to vote during the time it was in effect were U.S. citizens who had been eligible to vote.\n",
      "In Texas, where Republicans control both houses of the Legislature, lawmakers have introduced a bill that would in some ways expand on the proposed federal SAVE Act. It would require proof of citizenship for voter registration and compel state and local election officials to verify the citizenship status of everyone who is already registered.\n",
      "If a person’s citizenship cannot be verified, that person would be notified and allowed to vote in only congressional elections.\n",
      "Even as New Hampshire’s law faces legal challenges, state lawmakers are considering further changes.\n",
      "The state House gave preliminary approval last week to a bill that would create vouchers to cover the cost for indigent voters of obtaining a birth certificate, though opponents said asking voters to declare themselves poor would be demeaning. It also would instruct the secretary of state to make “reasonable efforts” to verify citizenship if someone is unable to provide documentation. Critics noted the office has access only to birth certificates issued in New Hampshire.\n",
      "“If you’re going to pass a bill, make sure that it can withstand litigation and make sure that it offers real solutions. This bill does neither,” Democratic Rep. Connie Lane said.\n",
      "In Durham, where voting takes place in the town’s high school, students enrolled in civics classes traditionally watch the process. They got an extra lesson during the recent town hall elections. A student who was old enough to vote wanted to register but did not have the documents to prove citizenship, according to Rachel Deane, the town clerk.\n",

      "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) — Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker sits at a table surrounded by University of Illinois researchers who will soon be out of work, their lab set to lose its federal funding and close next month. One researcher, saying she feels betrayed by the government, turns to thank Pritzker.\n",
      "“My husband sometimes shows me videos of you talking,” says Aline Delpomdor, a research specialist at the university’s Soybean Innovation Lab. “This was the first thing that gave me hope — that someone is speaking out. Somebody is defending us.”\n",
      "Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel empire, may seem like an unlikely champion for working-class people affected by the Trump administration. But he’s taken aim at President Donald Trump’s potential tax cuts, while backing universal health care and a higher federal minimum wage.\n",
      "The governor used a statewide tour this past week to present a path forward for national Democrats struggling to unify around a strategy to counter the Republican president, highlighting the effects of Trump’s early actions in Illinois. The three-day swing included meeting with farmers in a central Illinois barn to discuss agriculture and with older adults in suburban Chicago who are concerned about Social Security cuts. \n",
      "While far from the center of power in Washington, the stops resemble those of a future presidential contender in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina.\n",
      "“How do you play a role when you don’t have a vote?” Pritzker said in an interview with The Associated Press. “It’s hopefully reminding people who we are as a country, in a moment when I think people haven’t really stepped back and thought enough about democracy and our history — reminding people of that, using the bully pulpit to talk about that and then rallying the troops.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Pritzker has built alliances within the party for years as a top donor to Democratic campaigns and causes, giving millions from his personal fortune and helping candidates raise money. That includes a recent $500,000 donation that went to support the Democratic-backed candidate in next month’s Wisconsin Supreme Court race, a contest with big implications for the swing state and an election seen as a test of the national political climate. \n",
      "Lesser known than other potential 2028 contenders, Pritzker drew national attention in February when he used a joint budget and State of the State address to make the case for a parallel between Trump’s rhetoric and the rise of Nazi Germany. \n",
      "“If you think I’m overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,” Pritzker said.\n",
      "The speech stood in stark contrast to many of Pritzker’s fellow Democratic governors — who, at the same time, were on their way to Washington for face-to-face meetings with the newly sworn-in president. Pritzker skipped the gathering of the National Governors Association.\n",
      "Since then, the divide between Pritzker and other Democratic governors, particularly those potentially eyeing the party’s 2028 presidential nomination, has only widened.\n",
      "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently sat for a one-on-one meeting with Trump as she seeks to find “ common ground ” with him. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has launched a podcast in which he had friendly conversations with Trump loyalists, including Steve Bannon. \n",
      "Some Illinois Republicans walked out of the chamber during Pritzker’s speech. The state GOP has criticized Pritzker for overspending and helping create a migrant crisis in Chicago. \n",
      "“All the while, he jet-sets across the country giving political speeches, more interested in headlines and presidential speculation than actually governing this state,” Illinois Republican Party Chairman Don Tracy said. \n",
      "Pritzker has not relented in his criticism of Trump. On Tuesday, the governor spoke at the liberal Center for American Progress in Washington, where he described Trump’s early months as “true villainous cruelty by a few idiots.” During his meeting Wednesday with farmers in central Illinois, he warned that their “way of life is under attack right now.”\n",
      "“People will go out of business, lose jobs. And the impact on our broader economy, not just in the state of Illinois, but in the United States, could be truly devastating,” Pritzker told a barn full of farmers at a roundtable in Urbana, adding that they risk becoming “collateral damage” in Trump’s efforts.\n",
      "He has not spared Democrats, either. \n",
      "At the same roundtable — the kickoff of his statewide tour — Pritzker blasted the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, and other Democratic senators who backed a Republican-led spending bill. Pritzker said their support was an “enormous mistake.”\n",
      "U.S. Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill., who joined Pritzker at the roundtable, said the governor is helping “localize and tell the story of what this will mean for people.”\n",
      "Earlier, Pritzker stopped by the Soybean Innovation Lab, which is set to shut down April 15 with 30 employees set to be laid off.\n",
      "Delpomdor told Pritzker the cuts meant “everything we have done all these years is just lost.” Peter Goldsmith, the lab’s director, called the closure of the decade-old lab “surreal,” adding, “You can’t just grin and bear it.”\n",
      "“Very little thought has gone into the decisions that have been made,” Pritzker said. “And I think that six months from now, if we’re good enough at this, we will have been able to make some arguments that, maybe they’ve gone too far.” \n",
      "He also told the AP he is “optimistic because we are going to fight.”\n",
      "“It’s not that I think if we all just sit back that four years will go by and everything will be fine,” he said. “I think we need to put the work in, and I’m optimistic that we will.”\n",

      "BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) — President Donald Trump attended the NCAA wrestling championships on Saturday night for the second time in three years, the latest example of how he has mostly limited travel early in his new term to trips built around sports events.\n",
      "Trump arrived at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia to loud cheers and a standing ovation. He pumped his fists amid chants of “U-S-A!” As the matches occurred, Trump stood near the action and personally congratulated most of the winning wrestlers. Hours later, he left the arena, shaking hands along the way as the crowd roared. \n",
      "The Republican president spent Friday night at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, about 70 miles northeast of Philadelphia, on what was his first visit there of his second term. \n",
      "“We’re going to the big fight,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday evening. “I’ve always supported the wrestlers.” He added, “These are the great college wrestlers from the various schools.” \n",
      "Trump traveled with billionaire and top adviser Elon Musk. Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin greeted the president as he arrived at the Philadelphia airport. Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick and U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan were also at the arena sitting in the same section as Musk and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.\n",
      "In the two-plus months since returning to the White House, Trump attended the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the Daytona 500 in Florida, where his motorcade drove a portion of the track. While president-elect he went to a UFC fight in New York. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s more travel for sports than for policy announcements or official duties, though a long January swing took Trump to tour damage from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and wildfires in Los Angeles. He then gave a speech and visited the floor of Las Vegas’ Circa Resort & Casino before heading to Doral, Florida, to address a House Republican policy conference.\n",
      "Trump has long built his public and political persona around sporting events, and relishes turning up at live events to hear cheers from the crowd, even if some in attendance boo him. He also has signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports — an action which he points to frequently to fire up his core supporters. \n",

      "That’s despite Trump’s predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, having hosted the Chiefs after they won the title in 2023, a visit that was considered as also making up for the missed White House stop in 2020.\n",
      "“They missed their turn because of COVID,” Trump said of the Chiefs. \n",
      "The president has used most Saturdays and Sundays to play golf at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, though he also sometimes remained in Washington to give weekend speeches.\n",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — John Calipari is heading back to the Sweet 16 after sending a second straight Hall of Famer home from the NCAA Tournament’s “Region of Coaches.”\n",
      "One game after knocking out good friend Bill Self and the Kansas Jayhawks, Calipari’s 10th-seeded Arkansas Razorbacks beat longtime nemesis Rick Pitino and St. John’s 75-66 on Saturday.\n",
      "That earned Calipari an especially sweet 16th trip to the Sweet 16, with his fourth school. And, perhaps more deliciously, it ended Pitino’s chances of a long March Madness run with his second-seeded Red Storm.\n",
      "“Rick did a great job with his team all year,” Calipari said. “If they made a few shots, they would probably beat us. We were fortunate to get out.”\n",
      "Pitino and Calipari have crossed paths for almost 50 years, with a rivalry that peaked when Calipari was at Kentucky, where Pitino had won an NCAA title, and Pitino was down the road in Louisville. Although the two Hall of Famers insist they have no ill will toward one another, they are most definitely not friends.\n",
      "The coaches shared a polite pregame handshake and met at center court when it was over, with the Arkansas’ fans chants of “Wooo pig sooie!” finally heard over the Pitino-loving crowd.\n",
      "“They outplayed us. They deserve to move on and we don’t,” Pitino said. “That’s what March Madness is all about. No matter how good a regular season you have, you play this way, you’re going to get beat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The scoreboard: Calipari is 17-13 against Pitino, including the six NBA matchups they split. Cal is now 3-2 against his elder in the NCAA Tournament; in fact, the Arkansas coach entered this year’s brackets with 56 March Madness wins, tied for the most among active coaches with Michigan State’s Tom Izzo. Both are still in the field.\n",
      "Calipari has now taken UMass, Memphis, Kentucky and Arkansas to the Sweet 16. Pitino made it with Providence, Kentucky and Louisville, but never got out of the first weekend with Boston University, Iona or — so far — St. John’s.\n",
      "But Pitino has two national championships — with Kentucky and Louisville — to one for Calipari.\n",
      "“You know, he’s on Chapter 2 of his new book and we’re on Chapter 1,” Calipari said this week. “As a matter of fact, we’re probably on the first few pages of the chapter. It’s both of us writing another story and being able to come back here.”\n",
      "Calipari led the Wildcats to the 2012 national title — 16 years after Pitino won in Lexington — but after a five-year span in which the Wildcats won just one March Madness game, he defected to Arkansas to start fresh.\n",
      "Beset by early injuries, the Razorbacks lost their first five games in an unprecedentedly deep Southeastern Conference before earning their way into the NCAA Tournament after missing just one year.\n",
      "“We had a long, up-and-down season,” said Arkansas freshman Billy Richmond III, who scored 16 points on Saturday. “We all came together, put our egos to the side and became one heartbeat.”\n",
      "Calipari tried to get in good with the fans in Providence by talking about all the Italian restaurants he’s hit on Federal Hill — “ under the pineapple,” in the local parlance. But that was a losing battle this weekend: Whatever split there might be in Kentucky over their popularity, Providence is all Pitino.\n",
      "The 72-year-old New Yorker remains beloved in the city where he led the Friars to the 1987 Final Four. He continued to vacation in tony Newport for years, even as he climbed the coaching ladder, slid to the bottom, and started his way back up again.\n",
      "Although Arkansas led most of the game, the Pitino fans outshouted the Razorback backers, rising to a thunderous cheer when Zuby Ejiofor responded to a flagrant foul with a rim-shaking dunk. Big East Player of the Year RJ Luis Jr. followed with a steal and a dunk of his own to tie it 24-all, and the crowd sent St. John’s into a timeout with a chant of “Let’s go, Johnnies!”\n",
      "Arkansas led by as many as 13 in the second half and still had an eight-point edge before the Johnnies cut it to 62-60 with 6:11 to play. But Pitino, who has built his career on full-court defense and 3-point shooting, could only summon one of them when he needed it. \n",
      "St. John’s shot 2 for 22 from 3-point range — Arkansas was barely better, at 2 for 19 — and the Red Storm missed six straight from beyond the arc in the final minutes.\n",
      "“We thought we were championship-driven in our minds, but I have been disappointed before with this,” Pitino said. “I don’t mind going out with a loss, I just hate to see us play that way offensively. It’s just a bitter pill to swallow with that type of performance.”\n",

      "LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — Auburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl began his postgame NCAA Tournament news conference on Saturday night by advocating for the release of Edan Alexander, the last living American being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.\n",
      "Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier who grew up in the United States, is one of 59 hostages still in Gaza, more than half of whom are believed to be dead. Last week, Hamas said it would release Alexander and the bodies of four other hostages held there since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel if Israel recommitted to a stalled ceasefire agreement.\n",
      "Pearl, who is Jewish, made the plea for Alexander’s return after the top-seeded Tigers’ 82-70 victory over No. 9 Creighton, saying he sought his players’ permission to bring up the subject.\n",
      "“I get asked a lot how this basketball program has become so competitive over the last eight years,” Pearl said. “But for me, I believe it was God’s plan to give us this success, success beyond what we deserve. To give us this platform. To give us an opportunity to start this conference briefly and remind the world that Edan Alexander is still held hostage in Gaza right now. An American held hostage and not enough people in this country know his name.”\n",
      "Alexander’s father, Adi, said on Friday that he was more optimistic about the chances that the U.S. could secure his son’s safe return.\n",
      "Asked later what made him want to talk about the hostage situation and the Israel-Hamas war, Pearl — an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump — referenced his faith and family’s migration to the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oct. 7 was the worst day since the Holocaust for the Jewish people, and they say they want to do it again and again and again. We have American hostages in Gaza right now, and it’s unacceptable,” Pearl said. “And President Trump called it out, and said if they just free the hostages, the killing would stop. Free the hostages, and the killing will stop, and that’s up to Hamas.”\n",
      "Pearl has repeatedly voiced his support for Israel on social media, and during a radio interview last month with Dan Bongino, a conservative podcaster and Trump loyalist who has been named deputy director of the FBI, he said he supported Trump’s proposal to resettle the 2 million Palestinians who live in Gaza.\n",
      "By discussing the subject during one of the year’s most-watched sporting events, Pearl took his views to a broader audience.\n",
      "“This Jewish American loves his country more than anything else. At the same time, Israel, that is our ancestral homeland and it’s under attack,” he said. “It’s under siege. All it wants to do is live in peace with its neighbors.”\n",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — McNeese coach Will Wade has a signed six-year deal to take over as N.C. State’s next coach, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Saturday.\n",
      "The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the school hasn’t publicly discussed its coaching search.\n",
      "Wade’s second NCAA Tournament run in as many seasons with the Cowboys ended Saturday with a second-round loss to Purdue, which came two days after a first-round upset of his alma mater, Clemson. Wade’s two-year tenure in Lake Charles, Louisiana, marked a successful climb back after being fired at LSU in 2022 because of allegations of recruiting violations. Those were rooted in a federal corruption investigation in college basketball that became public in 2017, with N.C. State among the multiple schools entangled in that probe.\n",
      "OG Media first reported earlier this week that the two sides had reached an agreement for Wade to lead the Wolfpack, while CBS Sports was first to report the signing after the Purdue loss. The 42-year-old Wade had confirmed talks with N.C. State before the Clemson win, an unusually candid response compared with coaches typically deflecting questions about other jobs.\n",
      "“Just tell it like it is,” Wade said Wednesday.\n",
      "Asked about the N.C. State job again after Saturday’s loss to Purdue, Wade said: “I’ll worry about that tomorrow. Look, I’m an honest guy, but today I want to put a bow on everything with McNeese if we can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wade will replace Kevin Keatts, who was fired after eight seasons on March 9. That came less than a year after he guided N.C. State to its first Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament title since 1987 and its first Final Four trip since the late Jim Valvano’s “Cardiac Pack” did it in an improbable 1983 NCAA title run.\n",
      "Keatts had guided N.C. State to three NCAA bids and had the program in position for another when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of March Madness in 2020. But the Wolfpack went 12-19 this season to kill any lingering buzz from last year’s remarkable run.\n",
      "That ultimately led the school to move on from Keatts even though he was under contract until April 2030, putting N.C. State on the hook for roughly $6.9 million in base salary alone. And it marked a reset for the program, down to how it handles finances for roster construction with players able to profit from their athletic fame and revenue sharing set to start nationally next season.\n",
      "Wade’s first head-coaching job was a two-year stint at Chattanooga from 2013-15, followed by two NCAA bids in as many seasons at VCU before leaving for LSU in 2017. The peak of his tenure with the Tigers came in his second season, with LSU winning the Southeastern Conference regular-season title and reaching the Sweet 16.\n",
      "He returned to the sideline after his LSU exit at McNeese in 2023, with his tenure beginning with NCAA penalties that included a 10-game suspension to open his first season. But the Cowboys teams went on to win 58 games in two seasons, a rapid climb for a program that had won just 56 games combined in the five seasons before Wade’s arrival.\n",
      "“I think I needed somewhere that was going to embrace me and the town needed somebody to embrace them,” Wade said Saturday of his McNeese tenure. “It just worked. I can’t explain how. I guess the winning helps, but it worked. Just unforgettable.”\n",

      "The horror of the Joplin tornado is the subject of a new documentary film, released nearly 14 years after the twister struck Missouri with cataclysmic force, ripping into a hospital, destroying neighborhoods and killing around 160. \n",
      "“You see pictures of World War II, the devastation and all that with the bombing,” Kerry Sachetta, then the Joplin High School principal, told The Associated Press on the evening of May 22, 2011, after the school was destroyed. \n",
      "“That’s really what it looked like,” Sachetta said.\n",
      "As he spoke on that dreadful night, fires from gas leaks burned across town. The EF-5 twister, then the single deadliest in six decades, packed winds of 200 mph (320 kph). At times, it was nearly a mile (1.6 kilometers) wide. Left in its wake was a hellscape of cars crushed like soda cans and shaken residents roaming streets in search of missing family members. About 7,500 homes were damaged or destroyed.\n",
      "“The Twister: Caught in the Storm” was released last week by Netflix following a recent spate of deadly storms that have unleashed tornadoes, blinding dust storms and wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the most startling damage in Joplin was at St. John’s Regional Medical Center, where staff had only moments to hustle patients into the hallway before the 367-bed hospital was knocked off its foundation. \n",
      "Flying debris blew out windows and disabled the hospitals’ exposed generators, causing ventilators to stop working. The winds also scattered X-rays and medical records around 75 miles (121 kilometers) away. \n",
      "Five patients and one visitor died in the immediate aftermath. And other patients later died of injuries they suffered in the storm.\n",
      "On the morning after the storm, Dr. Jim Riscoe told the AP that some members of his emergency room staff showed up after the tornado with injuries of their own but worked through the night anyway.\n",
      "“It’s a testimony to the human spirit,” Riscoe said, comparing the scene to a nuclear disaster. “Cars had been thrown like playing cards. Power lines were sparking. I couldn’t believe it.”\n",
      "The building was so badly damaged it had to be razed the following year.\n",
      "The deaths from the storm were so numerous that a makeshift morgue was set up next to a football stadium in Joplin. Hundreds of others were injured in the city of 53,000. \n",
      "Among the dead was 18-year-old Will Norton who was headed home from his high school graduation when he was sucked out of his family’s SUV through the sunroof. His father desperately held on to his legs. Norton’s body was found five days later in a nearby pond.\n",
      "In the following years, his family kept his room as it was: an open pack of chewing gum, his trademark mismatched socks, his computer and the green screen that helped earn him a YouTube following for his travel chronicles.\n",
      "“It’s a little comfort to go in there, go back in time and remember how it was,” his father, Mark Norton, said close to the five-year anniversary.\n",
      "Around a dozen died in a single nursing home after the tornado tossed four vehicles, including a full-size van, into the building. Those who survived were scattered to nursing homes in four states, their records and medications blown away. Widespread phone outages then complicated efforts to locate the residents, some of whom had dementia.\n",
      "Officials still disgree about the final death toll. The federal storm center says 158 died while local officials count the deaths of three additional people, including a person struck by lightning after the tornado blew through the city.\n",
      "The tornado forced school officials to end the spring term nine days early. Six school buildings were destroyed, including the high school. Seven other buildings were badly damaged.\n",
      "The district scrambled to rebuild with federal funds, donations, insurance money and a $62 million bond, cobbling together a hodgepodge of temporary locations while construction was underway. Seniors and juniors took classes in a converted big-box store in a shopping mall, while freshmen and sophomores went to school in a building across town.\n",
      "Then-President Barack Obama was the commencement speaker during the high school’s 2012 commencement and then-Vice President Joe Biden attended the 2014 dedication of the new high school, calling the community the “heart and soul of America.”\n",
      "The dedication included two live eagles, the school’s mascot.

      "NEW YORK (AP) — Throughout the implosion of his once-skyrocketing Hollywood career, from his arrest almost exactly two years ago to his harassment and assault conviction, Jonathan Majors has maintained that he has never struck a woman.\n",
      "But on Monday, as Majors was in the midst of a comeback attempt and a PR push that returned him to magazine covers, Rolling Stone published an audio recording of a conversation between Majors and Grace Jabbari. Majors was found guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation for striking Jabbari in the head with an open hand and breaking her middle finger by squeezing it.\n",
      "“I aggressed you,” Majors acknowledges in the recording, confirming her description of him strangling her and pushing her against a car. The recording appeared to contradict Majors’ previous claims and upend his redemption tour just as his film “Magazine Dreams” opens in theaters Friday.\n",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Majors declined to address the recording, and whether he has assaulted women.\n",
      "“I can’t answer that,” Majors responded. “I can’t speak to that.”\n",
      "Majors, who was sentenced to probation and settled a lawsuit with Jabbari in November, is striving for an unusually swift rebound following a precipitous downfall. Before his March 2023 arrest, Majors was steering toward years of Marvel stardom and a possible Oscar nomination for Elijah Bynum’s “Magazine Dreams,” in which he plays a disturbed aspiring bodybuilder prone to violent outbursts. \n",

      "\n",
      "Two years later, Majors returns to the public eye with a pledge that he’s changed just months after completing a year of court-ordered domestic violence counseling. At the same time, he’s not directly addressing any of the allegations against him — including those from two previous partners, Emma Duncan and Maura Hooper, who in statements submitted pretrial, detailed physically violent and emotionally abusive incidents that bear some similarities to the Jabbari case. \n",
      "“It’s not something I can talk about legally,” Majors says. “I said to my wife the other day, I’ve changed. I don’t recognize myself. I don’t recognize that guy. I’m in a completely different place. There’s no doubt that I was in turmoil. That guy then didn’t have any tools to deal with things. I don’t know if I liked the guy then. He was accomplished, he was doing great things in certain ways. But I don’t know if I would have hung out with him.”\n",
      "Majors, who sat for an interview at a Manhattan hotel without a publicist present, spoke reflectively about his experience of the past two years — with the exception of anything specifically related to the conviction, the additional abuse allegations or the women who say he harmed them. Despite never naming a misdeed, Majors says he is reformed.\n",
      "“I’d say to anyone who cares to listen: I’ve had two years of deep thought and mediation and rumination on myself and my actions, my community, my industry,” he said. “I’m stronger now. I’m wiser now. I’m better now.”\n",
      "Not everyone is convinced. Hooper, who met Majors at Yale Drama School and dated him from 2013 to 2015, described a traumatizing and controlling relationship. A year after their relationship ended, Majors learned of her having a relationship with someone he knew, she said. According to Hooper’s statement, Majors called her and shamed her for having an abortion, which he had encouraged, and told her to kill herself. \n",
      "“The level of anger that I experienced from this man, I don’t know you exorcise that from your life or your behavior in only 52 weeks,” Hooper told the AP. “People go to therapy for years. I went to therapy for years after Jonathan Majors just to get my mind back.”\n",
      "Hooper and Duncan’s statements were ultimately not allowed as evidence during the trial, but they remain public record. Attorneys for Majors have denied some of their claims, describing both relationships as “toxic.” \n",
      "Duncan, who dated and was engaged to Majors from 2015 to 2019, described at least eight physical or threatening encounters in her statement. During an argument in 2016 while driving in Chautauqua, New York, he threatened to strangle and kill her, she said. At a spa in Santa Fe, New Mexico, she discovered text messages between Majors and another woman and began packing to leave. He pushed her into couch and began choking her while saying he was going to kill her, Duncan said. (She didn’t respond to an email from the AP seeking comment. Attorneys for Jabbari also didn’t respond to emails.)\n",
      "“There is a documented history of 10 years of abuse of women where he calls women ‘sluts,’ he calls us ‘fat whores,’ he tells us to kill ourselves,” Hooper says. “When I hear people say, ‘Come on, how come he can’t come back into the fold?’ I don’t know that those people have read this or understand that we’re talking about a pattern.”\n",
      "A changed political climate and several recent cases, including the overturning of Harvey Weinstein’s New York sexual assault conviction, have suggested Hollywood has entered a new chapter in the #MeToo movement. Majors’ attempted comeback is one of the most conspicuous tests to the fraying curbs of cancellation and #MeToo vindication.\n",
      "“We’re suffering a period of tremendous political retrenchment and backlash in this movement,” says Debra Katz, the civil rights attorney who represented Christine Blasey Ford, accuser of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, along with Weinstein accusers. “Much of what we’ve fought for seems to be on the line.”\n",

      "\n",
      "But women are still coming forward, and Katz believes companies and industries will hold the accused accountable. For his part, Majors, who was dropped from all projects following his conviction, has no new films announced. “Magazine Dreams,” which debuted at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival before his arrest and was subsequently dropped by Searchlight Pictures, is being released by Briarcliff Entertainment, the indie distributor of “The Apprentice.”\n",
      "“Jonathan made a mistake. There was due process. Justice was served. And then we move on, which I think is generally how we like to think this country operates,” Tom Ortenberg, chief executive of Briarcliff, said Thursday. “We’re faced with two choices: Should ‘Magazine Dreams’ be allowed to be seen? Or should we burn the negative?”\n",
      "Numerous A-listers, including Michael B. Jordan and Matthew McConaughey, have advocated for Majors’ return to Hollywood. Still, Katz believes Majors’ comeback will ultimately sputter because it hasn’t gone beyond the strategy of what she describes as “get a good PR firm and show my soft side.”\n",
      "“I think he’s going to suffer a significant comeuppance,” says Katz. “He hasn’t owned up to the behavior. He hasn’t apologized. The only thing he appears to be sorry about is that he got caught.”\n",
      "For Majors, his self-examination has focused more on an earlier experience he suggests was at the root of what he calls his turmoil. \n",
      "“There was a lot of trauma that was piled up and ignored. The best way to describe it is it as an energy that unfortunately was there,” says Majors. “I was feeding the wrong wolf. And that wolf became unignorable. And I was really good at moving fast and outrunning the rabid wolf of trauma. The best thing that could have happened to me — not to my career but to me — was to have to face it.”\n",
      "Majors, who was raised by his pastor mother in Texas after his father left, says from the age of 9 to about 13, he was the victim of multiple incidents of sexual abuse, from, he says, “two male family members and my sisters’ friends who were older than me — they were older than her.”\n",
      "“It felt like kids being kids and then it became something different very quickly,” Majors says. “And then it became a pattern.”\n",
      "Majors only recently began wrestling with this past, he says, working through it in therapy and in conversations with his family. A phone call with his sister, he says, reawakened memories.\n",
      "“It was an experience that I just killed in my head,” Majors says, tearing up.\n",
      "“It’s not a boo-hoo-bro, so-sad-for-you situation,” he says, wiping away tears. “It’s life. It’s the hand you’re dealt, and I didn’t know how to play those cards. I’m learning how to play those cards.”\n",

      "Now, Majors says, he’s never been happier. On Tuesday, he and Meagan Good were wed in a small, impromptu ceremony in Los Angeles officiated by his mother. “We called the family and said, ‘Hey, jump on FaceTime,’” he says, calling it the best day of his life.\n",
      "“Magazine Dreams,” he thought, would never see the light of day. Now, though, he’s hopeful he can act again.\n",
      "“I now understand that acting is in many ways my ministry. It’s in many ways my calling,” Majors says. “If it’s not, I’m waiting for someone to tell me it’s not. I’m waiting for God to tell me it’s not. He’s not said that.”\n",

      "LOS ANGELES (AP) — “Severance” is beloved by critics and audiences alike. But there was a time when star Adam Scott and Ben Stiller, who executive produces and directs the Apple TV+ series, worried it might never get made. \n",
      "The show — a dark, surrealist commentary on our work-obsessed culture that was hardly guaranteed to reap mass appeal — was set to start production on its first season in March 2020. Then the lockdowns began.\n",
      "One pandemic, two historic Hollywood strikes and a three-year gap between Seasons 1 and 2 later, Apple TV+ confirmed a third season Friday, the morning after the release of the second season’s finale. Scott and Stiller spoke to The Associated Press in advance; the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n",

      "\n",
      "SCOTT: It’s funny because I feel like I was kind of working on it the whole time. I mean, I guess doing press and talking about the character and the show is sort of keeping it kind of fresh in my mind the whole time. But also, Ben and Dan (Erickson, the show’s creator, writer and executive producer) and I talk all the time and I’m always peppering them with questions about where things are going or what we’re doing. We were kind of always talking about it and kind of mulling it over the entire time so, by the time we started shooting, I did feel pretty prepped and ready to go in. But it was challenging because, like the show itself, the character — both the “innie” and the “outie” — kind of expand a little bit and the aperture sort of widens.\n",
      "STILLER: I mean, it’s constantly in process. That’s what the process of making the show was on Season 1 and also on Season 2. And I don’t know if I could explain the process, but it’s very fluid, even though it’s obviously a show that has a lot of specifics that we’re always trying to think about. That’s, I think, one of the reasons why it’s fluid actually, is because we’re always looking at what we’re doing and looking back at what we’ve shot and edited and just really trying to track it. It goes on all the way through until the final sound mix, really.\n",
      "STILLER: Yeah. We started in October 2022 and we shot through until the strike and we had completed about seven episodes at that point. And then we had to regroup for the last three after the strike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "STILLER: In both seasons, we constantly go back and we’re always looking at stuff and sometimes we’ll pick up something. But that’s part of the process of making the show. And one of the, I think, luxuries of being able to make the show like this is that we’re able to kind of look at what we made and go, “Wait, you know, this doesn’t work,” or “That doesn’t work,” or “Let’s try this new idea.”\n",
      "This image released by Apple TV+ shows Ben Stiller, left, and Britt Lower on the set of “Severance.” (Apple TV+ via AP)\n",

      "So, any time we’ve had delays, especially the first season we were in prep and were about to start shooting, then COVID hit so we had an extra six months to work on the scripts and all the other ideas that we were developing. And the strike, same thing. You know, we couldn’t write, obviously, but I was allowed to edit because I’m a non-writing producer on the show, so I edited throughout the whole strike period, which was really helpful when we went back in.\n",
      "SCOTT: We were, of course, in full support of the strikes, both writers and actors. But yeah, for this show in particular, we were just like, “Good Lord. OK, let’s close up shop and see when we can get back together.” And it ended up, like Ben said, being beneficial in the long run.\n",
      "STILLER: No. I felt like we’d shot enough that we had to at least complete the job. I remember at one point on Season 1 when we were starting up and, you know, we were kind of down the line and then COVID. And at one point I wondered if we actually were going to make the show because a lot of productions got canceled when COVID happened. And, you know, we were lucky enough to make it through that.\n",
      "SCOTT: Over the pandemic, like the shelter-at-home portion of pandemic, I was checking in with Ben or Nicky Weinstock, one of the producers, constantly, just like, “Is this still a show? Are we still going to do it?” I did not believe that we were actually ever going to make it at a certain point.\n",

      "NEW YORK (AP) — An Orthodox Jewish passenger says a United Airlines pilot forcibly removed him from an airplane bathroom while he was experiencing constipation, exposing his genitalia to other flyers during a flight from Tulum, Mexico, to Houston.\n",
      "Yisroel Liebb, of New Jersey, described his trip through allegedly unfriendly skies in a federal lawsuit this week against the airline and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, whose officers he said boarded the plane upon landing and took him away in handcuffs.\n",
      "Liebb and a fellow Orthodox Jewish traveler said the pilot made disparaging remarks about their faith. They said they were forced to miss a connecting flight to New York City while U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers paraded them through an airport terminal, placed them in holding cells and searched their luggage.\n",
      "“CBP Officers responded to reports of a disturbance on a flight at the request of the airline,” CBP Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs Hilton Beckham said. “Due to the ongoing litigation, we are unable to provide any further comment.”\n",

      "In the lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, Liebb said he was in the bathroom in the back of the plane for about 20 minutes on Jan. 28 when a flight attendant woke Sebbag from a nap and asked Sebbag to check on him.\n",

      "About 10 minutes later, with Liebb still indisposed, the pilot approached Sebbag and asked him to check on Liebb, the lawsuit says. The pilot then yelled at Liebb to leave the bathroom immediately, the lawsuit says.\n",
      "Liebb said he told the pilot that he was finishing up and would be out momentarily.\n",
      "The pilot responded by breaking the lock, forcing the bathroom door open and pulling Liebb out with his pants still around his ankles, exposing his genitalia to Sebbag, flight attendants, and nearby passengers, according to the lawsuit.\n",
      "Liebb and Sebbag said the pilot then pushed them back to their seats while threatening to have them arrested and making remarks about their faith and how “Jews act.”\n",

      "LONDON (AP) — The British government on Saturday ordered an investigation into the country’s “energy resilience” after an electrical substation fire shut Heathrow Airport for almost a day and raised concerns about the U.K.'s ability to withstand disasters or attacks on critical infrastructure. \n",
      "While Heathrow Airport said it was now “fully operational,” thousands of passengers remained stuck, and airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travelers to their destinations. \n",
      "Inconvenienced passengers, angry airlines and concerned politicians all want answers about how one seemingly accidental fire could shut down Europe’s busiest air hub.\n",
      "“This is a huge embarrassment for Heathrow airport. It’s a huge embarrassment for the country that a fire in one electricity substation can have such a devastating effect,” said Toby Harris, a Labour Party politician who heads the National Preparedness Commission, a group that campaigns to improve resilience.\n",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he’d asked the National Energy System Operator, which oversees U.K. gas and electricity networks, to “urgently investigate” the fire, “to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.” \n",
      "It is expected to report initial findings within six weeks.\n",
      "“The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow,” Miliband said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathrow announced its own review, to be led by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, a member of the airport’s board.\n",
      "Heathrow Chairman Paul Deighton said Kelly will look at “the robustness and execution of Heathrow’s crisis management plans, the airport’s response during the incident and how the airport recovered.”\n",
      "More than 1,300 flights were canceled and some 200,000 people stranded Friday after an overnight fire at a substation 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away cut power to Heathrow, and to more than 60,000 properties.\n",
      "Heathrow said Saturday it had “added flights to today’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers.” British Airways, Heathrow’s biggest airline, said it expected to operate about 85% of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport Saturday. \n",
      "While many passengers managed to resume stalled journeys, others remained in limbo.\n",
      "Laura Fritschie from Kansas City was on vacation with her family in Ireland when she learned that her father had died. On Saturday she was stranded at Heathrow after her BA flight to Chicago was canceled at the last minute.\n",
      "“I’m very frustrated,” she said. “This was my first big vacation with my kids since my husband died, and ... now this. So I just want to go home.”\n",
      "Residents in west London described hearing a large explosion and then seeing a fireball and clouds of smoke when the blaze ripped through the substation. The fire was brought under control after seven hours, but the airport was shut for almost 18 hours. A handful of flights took off and landed late Friday.\n",
      "Police said they do not consider the fire suspicious, and the London Fire Brigade said its investigation would focus on the substation’s electrical distribution equipment.\n",
      "Still, the huge impact of the fire left authorities facing questions about Britain’s creaking infrastructure, much of which has been privatized since the 1980s. The center-left Labour government has vowed to improve the U.K.'s delay-plagued railways, its aged water system and its energy network, promising to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy independence through investment in wind and other renewable power sources.\n",
      "“The last 40, 50 years we’ve tried to make services more efficient,” said Harris. “We’ve stripped out redundancy, we’ve simplified processes. We’ve moved towards a sort of ‘just in time’ economy. There is an element where you have to make sure you’re available for ‘just in case.’ You have to plan for things going wrong.”\n",
      "Heathrow is one of the world’s busiest airports for international travel, and saw 83.9 million passengers last year. \n",
      "Chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he was “proud” of the way airport and airline staff had responded.\n",
      "“The airport didn’t shut for days. We shut for hours,” he told the BBC.\n",
      "Woldbye said Heathrow’s backup power supply, designed for emergencies, worked as expected, but it wasn’t enough to run the whole airport, which uses as much energy as a small city.\n",
      "“That’s how most airports operate,” said Woldbye, who insisted “the same would happen in other airports” faced with a similar blaze.\n",
      "But Willie Walsh, who heads aviation trade organization IATA, said the episode “begs some serious questions.”\n",
      "“How is it that critical infrastructure – of national and global importance – is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport,” he said.\n",
      "Walsh said “Heathrow has very little incentive to improve” because airlines, not the airport, have to pay the cost of looking after disrupted passengers.\n",
      "Friday’s disruption was one of the most serious since the 2010 eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which shut Europe’s airspace for days.\n",
      "Passengers on about 120 flights were in the air when Friday’s closure was announced and found themselves landing in different cities, and even different countries.\n",

      "“In many parts of the world, a crucial source of objective news is gone, and only censored state-sponsored news media is left to fill the void,” the lawsuit said.\n",
      "Lake has described the broadcast agency as a “giant rot” that needs to be stripped down and rebuilt.\n",

      "The lawsuit charges that the Trump administration has effectively shut it down unlawfully in the past week. Republicans have complained that the news source is infected by left-wing propaganda, a contention its operators say isn’t backed up factually.\n",
      "“The second Trump administration has taken a chainsaw to the agency as a whole in an attempt to shutter it completely,” the lawsuit said.

      "In its lawsuit, the organizations called the denial of funding unprecedented and said it has already forced operations to be significantly scaled back. “Without its congressionally appropriated funds, RFE/RL will also be forced to stop the vast majority of its journalistic work and will be at risk of ceasing to exist as an organization,” they argued.\n",

      "NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance. \n",
      "The force is enormous — it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful — it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate. \n",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, which scientists have long thought, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year. \n",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven’t worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe. \n",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe’s history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around. \n",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements — exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape — support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we’ve thought about cosmology and start over,” said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.\n",
      "It’s not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026. And other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency’s Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. \n",
      "“We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements” at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.\n",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.\n",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what’s called the Big Crunch. It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas. \n",

      "After Chief Justice John Roberts rebuked calls this week by the Trump administration to impeach judges, social media users falsely claimed that he and other high-level legal professionals are part of a “secretive, invite only club.” \n",
      "Many questioned the motives of members, hinting at coordinated efforts to oppose President Donald Trump.\n",
      "Among those named was U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who Trump had demanded be removed from the bench for his order blocking deportation flights that the president was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from 18th century law.\n",
      "But the group in question — the American Inns of Court — is hardly secretive given its large public presence, and there is no evidence that members are involved in nefarious activities targeting Trump. Roberts is no longer an active member and Boasberg is the president of a chapter that is no longer affiliated with the parent association.\n",
      "Here’s a closer look at the facts.\n",
      "CLAIM: Roberts, Boasberg and other powerful legal professionals are part of a secret, invite-only club that is working against Trump.\n",
      "THE FACTS: This is false. Roberts was a member of the Edward Coke Appellate Inn of Court chapter of the organization prior to his confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2005, but he is not currently an active member of the organization, according to Executive Director Malinda Dunn. \n",
      "Boasberg is the president of the Edward Bennett Williams Inn of Court, but the chapter disaffiliated from the parent association about 10 years ago when it decided it no longer wanted to pay dues to the national group, Dunn said. He was an active member prior to the chapter’s decision to operate independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Information on the American Inns of Court is readily available online. Chapters also have their own websites, which often include details about programs they host for members, typically focused on networking, education and mentorship. Dunn said that members have a wide range of political opinions, but that the organization itself is “assiduously apolitical.” \n",
      "Some on social media, however, baselessly claimed that there is more to the group than meets the eye.\n",
      "“It has been revealed that Chief Justice John Roberts is part of an elite, invite-only group called the American Inns of Court, alongside some of the most openly anti-Trump judges in D.C.,” reads one X post.\n",
      "And yet a check of other members reveals a diverse group. Many current and former Supreme Court justices have been members of the American Inns of Court, according to Dunn, including Sandra Day O’Connor, Neil Gorsuch, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Clarence Thomas. \n",
      "Inns of Court have existed in the United Kingdom for hundreds of years. The American system, founded in 1980 out of discussions among legal professionals, including Chief Justice Warren Burger, is loosely based on this concept from across the pond.\n",
      "The American Inns of Court states on its website that it is “dedicated to professionalism, ethics, civility, and excellence” and that its mission is to “inspire the legal community to advance the rule of law by achieving the highest level of professionalism through example, education, and mentoring.”\n",
      "O’Connor said in a 2015 video that “maintaining and improving an ethics of professionalism is what the American Inns of Court are all about.”\n",
      "There are more than 300 active chapters across the U.S. Each one manages its own membership and some are limited to practitioners in a certain legal field. Roberts’ former chapter, for example, states that “members are elected to the Inn after being nominated by a current member” and that they must be “actively engaged in appellate practice.”\n",
      "Dunn said chapters are advised to ensure that their members include legal professionals with different levels of experience. Some may hold membership drives to recruit new faces.\n",
      "Roberts is currently an honorary bencher in The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, an inn of court in the U.K. This is a purely ceremonial role that, according to Dunn. British inns of court will always offer such a position to Supreme Court justices when they are confirmed, she said.\n",

      "THE FACTS: Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday that Border Patrol apprehended 8,326 people on the U.S.-Mexico border last month. But U.S. government data show that Border Patrol routinely averaged below that number in the 1960s.\n",
      "While February marked the lowest arrest total in decades, Border Patrol averaged less than February 2025 for the first seven years of 1960s. The government website does not track U.S.-Mexico border totals before 1960. Border Patrol’s monthly average was 1,752 arrests in 1961.\n",

      "TRUMP: “Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: That figure, which Trump cites regularly, is highly inflated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported more than 10.8 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through December 2024. \n",
      "But that’s arrests, not people. Under asylum restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests.\n",
      "There is no evidence other countries are sending their criminals or people with mental illness across the border, despite this frequent line from Trump. \n",

      "THE FACTS: Trump appeared to be referencing a payment of $58.6 million — one of two the city received last month. The payment was a federal reimbursement under the Shelter and Services Program, which was created to support local governments and non-government organizations that provide support to noncitizens released by immigration authorities.\n",
      "Liz Garcia, a city spokesperson, said at the time that these reimbursements included $19 million in claims for hotel costs. The two payments totaled over $80.5 million for services delivered between November 2023 and October 2024.\n",

      "TRUMP: “Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it’s happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that. It won’t be much.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: Trump is banking on the idea that taxing imports is the road to riches for the United States. Most economists say Trump’s tariffs would hurt the country, as they’re tax increases that could raise the costs of goods in ways that could also harm economic growth. Trump suggests that the impact on inflation would be minimal.\n",
      "When the Yale University Budget Lab looked at the tariffs that Trump imposed Tuesday on Canada, Mexico and China, it found that inflation would increase a full percentage point, growth would fall by half a percentage point and the average household would lose about $1,600 in disposable income.\n",
      "TRUMP: “Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. ... 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. And money is being paid to many of them, and we are searching right now.”\n",

      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security’s software system based on the COBOL programming language, which doesn’t use a specific format for dates. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization Wired first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration.\n",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration’s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these people were receiving benefits.\n",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million. As of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.\n",

      "TRUMP: “Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.”\n",
      "THE FACTS: Inflation peaked at 9.1% in 2022 under President Joe Biden, but Trump did not inherit a disastrous economy by any measure. The unemployment rate ticked down to a low 4% in January, the month he took office, while the economy expanded a healthy 2.8% in 2024. Inflation-adjusted incomes have grown steadily since mid-2023. And inflation, while showing signs of stickiness in recent months and still elevated at 3% in January, is down from its 2022 peak.\n",
      "Still, concern about the economy was a key driver behind support for Trump during the 2024 election. The average price of basic consumer goods in particular has seen major spikes in recent years. A dozen large eggs, for example, went from a low of $1.33 in August 2020 to $4.82 in January 2023. They decreased in price to $2.07 in September 2023, but are currently on the rise again, at $4.95 as of January.\n",

      "Biden had set up a non-binding goal that EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office revoking that goal.\n",

      "\n",
      "THE FACTS: Zelenskyy was elected to a five-year term in 2019, and the next presidential elections had been scheduled for spring 2024. But Ukrainian law prohibits parliamentary or presidential elections during a state of martial law, so Zelenskyy has remained in office. He has said he believes elections will be held in Ukraine after martial law is lifted. The country would need to amend the law if it decided to hold a vote. \n",

      "\n",
      "According to the United Nations’ refugee agency, some 6.9 million Ukrainian refugees have been registered worldwide since February 2022. Of those, millions remain outside the country due to the war. It would be nearly impossible for all of those who have been displaced to participate in an election, potentially robbing millions of their right to vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, around 800,000 soldiers are currently serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces as they struggle to contain Russian advances. An election would necessitate pulling soldiers off the front lines to vote, weakening Ukraine’s military position. Additionally, those fighting would be unable to run for office, a right that is guaranteed to them by Ukrainian law. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many Ukrainians are living in areas under Russian occupation, essentially precluding their participation in any electoral process.

      "The video “exploded over night,” Budnick said. So much so that she went back the next day to make another one “because I’m like, I can’t let this go.”\n",
      "Since then she has promoted the adoption of such imaginative dog breeds as the “Teacup werewolf” and the “Speckled freckled cuddle calf.” Then there’s the “French baguette long lady” and the “Creamsicle push-up pup.” \n",
      "The shelter does get its share of pit bull mixes. A December video featuring several of them in festive costumes with Budnick singing “I Want a Pitt-o-potomous for Christmas” has been viewed more than 5 million times. \n",
      "While it is gratifying to gain visibility, Budnick said, the real payoff is in the adoptions. Data provided by the shelter shows dog adoptions increased by just over 25% between 2021 and 2024. \n",
      "“We’ll get calls from all over. And it’s not just local here to Tennessee even,” said Metro Animal Care and Control Director Ashley Harrington. “We’ve had an adopter from Canada. We’ve had ones from states all over.” \n",
      "She said people often call asking about a specific, made-up dog breed from one of the videos. “It’s been pretty great, and it’s been fun for our staff.”\n",
      "The popularity of Budnick’s videos have also led to donations of both money and supplies. Letters to the shelter referencing her videos are taped to a wall in the volunteer room.\n",
      "Still, like many other shelters in the South, it’s overcrowded. \n",
      "Budnick has one thing to say about that situation: “Spay and neuter, spay and neuter, spay and neuter.”\n",

      "Budnick started taking photos as a kid. While on camping trips, she’d take nature pictures with a 35 mm Canon AE-1. In high school she took photography classes and learned to make her own prints in a darkroom. But eventually she stopped taking pictures. \n",
      "That changed when she adopted a dog. \n",
      "“When I got Ruby, my 13-year-old, she was five weeks old, and I started taking pictures of her,” she said. A few months later, Budnick adopted Ruby’s sister, and a few months after that she began as a volunteer photographer at the shelter. “So really, my dogs got me back into it.”\n",
      "With her photos and videos, Budnick fights against the stigma that the shelter is a sad place with dogs no one would want. In many of the videos, she holds even the large dogs in her arms and gets her face licked. \n",
      "“You see them running around in the videos when they’re in playgroup, and you see them cuddling, and you see their goofy smiles when I’m holding them, and it just really showcases them,” she said. \n",
      "Budnick’s success has been noticed. She loves it when other shelters copy her ideas, or even lip sync over her videos while showing their own dogs, but she’s not interested in taking on more work. She has a regular job in addition to volunteering for the shelter between 7-10 hours each week, but she doesn’t mind the long hours.\n",
      "“I’m just having fun,” she said. “I absolutely love dogs. I think they’re the best thing on earth.”\n",
