This application provides a framework for conversational interaction with an AI-enhanced agent that makes finding the news most interesting to the user a hands-free experience.

It is anticipated that this will provide an API service for projects like Jarvus (<https://www.github.com/matthewapeters/gpt4all_agent>) which provides speech-to-text and text-to-speech services locally.
